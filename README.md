# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-with-Min-Heap
This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph using a min-heap data structure. It features a `MinHeap` class for priority queue operations and a `WeightedGraph` class for graph representation, showcasing efficient graph traversal and distance calculations.
